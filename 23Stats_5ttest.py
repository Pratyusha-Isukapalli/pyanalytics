#The Student’s t-Test is a statistical hypothesis test for testing 
#whether two samples are expected to have been drawn from the same 
#population. It is named for the pseudonym “Student” used by 
#William Gosset, who developed the test.
#The test works by checking the means from two samples to see 
#if they are significantly different from each other. It does 
#this by calculating the standard error in the difference 
#between means, which can be interpreted to see how likely 
#the difference is, if the two samples have the same mean 
#(the null hypothesis).
#The t statistic calculated by the test can be interpreted 
#by comparing it to critical values from the t-distribution. 
#The critical value can be calculated using the degrees of 
#freedom and a significance level with the percent point 
#function (PPF).

#A One Sample T-Test is a statistical test used to evaluate the null hypothesis that the mean m of a 1D sample dataset of independant observations is equal to the true mean μ of the population from which the data is sampled. In other words, our null hypothesis is that :m=μ
