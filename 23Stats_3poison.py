#Poision Distribution
#A Poisson distribution is a distribution which shows the 
#likely number of times that an event will occur within a 
#pre-determined period of time. It is used for independent 
#events which occur at a constant rate within a given interval 
#of time. The Poisson distribution is a discrete function, meaning
# that the event can only be measured as occurring or not as
# occurring, meaning the variable can only be measured in whole numbers.
##We use the seaborn python library which has in-built functions 
#to create such probability distribution graphs. Also the scipy 
#package helps is creating the binomial distribution.
